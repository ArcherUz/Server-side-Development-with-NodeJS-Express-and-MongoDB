This is a server side web development project that I followed on Coursera: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs"></a>. <br> Made by professor <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs#instructors">Jogesh K. Muppala</a>, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br>

This project has examined:
  - NodeJS and NodeJS modules using Express for building web servers
  - basic CRUD operations, NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS
  - REST concepts and a RESTful API
  - basic authentication and security
  - backend as a service (BaaS) approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services
